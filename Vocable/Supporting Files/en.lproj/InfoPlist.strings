/* Camera usage description */
NSCameraUsageDescription = "Vocable uses ARKit head tracking to detect the user's face as seen in the device's TrueDepth front camera feed for the purpose of controlling an on-screen pointer, allowing users with limited mobility to interact with the app. Head orientation and position data is used expressly for controlling the on-screen pointer. That head tracking data is not stored or transmitted in any way. Vocable needs permission to use the camera for this purpose.";
